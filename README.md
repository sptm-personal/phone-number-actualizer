# Phone Number Actualizer

## Description

This is a small piece of software working via Asterisk AMI. It just takes phone numbers from a file (line by line), calls these numbers via AMI and tries to understand by AMI events if given numbers are valid.

## Installation

Please check .env.example first â€” you need to have .env file for the app to work properly.
Besides that, it's quite simple to run the app:

```bash
npm install
node app.js
```
